This project demonstrates a complete DevOps infrastructure setup using modern cloud-native technologies. It showcases the deployment and management of containerized applications on Kubernetes, with infrastructure managed as code using Terraform, complete automation orchestrated by Ansible, and automated CI/CD pipelines powered by Jenkins. Ansible playbooks automate the entire infrastructure lifecycle from tool installation and cluster provisioning to application deployment and ongoing management.
